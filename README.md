# NRF24L01-Drone-Controller
Home made drone remote controller based on arduino and joystick module with NRF24L01 as transmitter.
It runs on 2.4 ghz and performs well in Line of Sight. However the range of control is very limited due to the NRF transmitter
Hence this is good for use with home made micro drones but if you want to make bigger(f250-f450 size) drones, this is not recommended due to its low range. This can be modified to be used with xbee modules to increase range.
# N.B- Use the code very carefully. Double check received data on the receiver side before using it on any aerial vehicle.
